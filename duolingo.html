                Duolingo is a digital language learning platform that currently
                offers 37 languages for English Speakers. I worked with a team of
                four other students to explore the usability of lessons for
                non-latin writing systems.

              <div class="proj-section-content">
                <p>We sent out a screener looking for participants interested in
                  learning a new language with an unfamiliar writing system.
                  We focused of people interested in Japanese and Korean because
                  there was the most interest in those languages.

              <div class="proj-sub-section-header">Interviews</div>
              <div class="proj-section-content">
                <p>User interviews are a fast way to learn about users and what they think, feel, and need.
                  My team conducted 10 60-minute, in-depth user interviews (I conducted two) using
                  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_MN6KVLgKFaIVS6lio9ohXjOwGrq2u2Qn5OsOK7S2Ek/edit">this moderator's guide</a>.
                  While 5-8 interviews would have been sufficient, all five researchers wanted to conduct interviews.
                </p>
                <p>We chose to do all of our research on the desktop website because
                  casual Duolingo users reported that they preferred to use desktop
                  (the mobile app is limited unless users pay for premium). 
                </p>
                <p>We had participants complete three tasks: </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Navigate to Duolingo’s homepage and explain what it communicates to them</li>
                  <li>Navigate to and explain the Characters page</li>
                  <li>Complete two lessons on either Japanese or Korean Characters</li>
                </ol>
              </div>

              <div class="proj-section-header">Key findings & Recommendations</div>
              <div class="proj-sub-section-header">Overall</div>
              <div class="proj-section-content">
                <p>All ten participants completed the tasks successfully and without any assistance.
                  They reported that the interface was easy to use, clean, and intuitive (easy to jump in & get started).
                  The auditory features helped them remember the pronunciation of the characters they were studying.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="proj-sub-section-header">Lack of instruction</div>
              <div class="proj-section-content">
                <p>The Korean langauge had a "build character" exercise,
                  and participants assumed they should drag & drop instead of clicking
                  on components that automatically filled the blue section of the character.
                  We recommend adding a more thorough explanation that Korean
                  characters are made of building blocks. Additionally, it might be helpful to
                  include an animation of a few characters being built.
                </p>
                <p>Participants on both languages were unsure how the "matching"
                  questions worked - most people assumed they would drag & drop
                  instead of just clicking on one question from each column. Some
                  people didn't notice there were two columns because they are so
                  close to each other. We recommended making a clearer
                  distinction between the left and right column, and drawing a line
                  connecting the two selected buttons.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="proj-sub-section-header">Mechanisms around incorrect answers</div>
              <div class="proj-section-content">
                <p>Most participants did not notice Duolingo displayed the correct answer
                  after they got a question wrong. No participant commented on the fact
                  that questions they got wrong were repeated until they got the
                  answer right, and when asked, participants were unsure as to when
                  they would get repeat questions. We recommend that the correct
                  answer be displayed more prominately and that Duolingo communicates
                  that people will be asked the same question over and over until
                  they get the answer right (e.g., “Don’t worry. We’ll try this question again.”).
                  When those questions are displayed again, they could be flagged
                  with the note “Let’s try this one more time”.

              <div class="proj-section-content">
                <p>Participants were unsatisfied that they were not quizzed on their
                  ability to write characters.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  “[Duolingo] didn't have a feature to learn how to write it. [I] don't think
                  people who are new to the language will be able to write it from this lesson.
                  Maybe only be able to recognize the character and the pronunciation...”</blockquote>
                <p>We recommend that Duolingo continue their roll out the
                  beta feature “trace a character” which we saw during one of our
                  user interviews.

              <div class="proj-section-content">
                <p>Users wanted to control the content of their lessons
                  and understand the purpose of the content. For example:
                <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Choose which characters to learn next</li>
                  <li>Want to see simple vocabulary and / or grammar integrated</li>
                  <li>Want to understand how lessons play a part in learning the language overall</li>
                </ul>
                <p>From prior experience, the moderators knew that characters
                  were picked so that users would learn enough characters to start
                  learning actual words. We recommend that Duolingo convey that,
                  so users don't worry about which characters they are learning, and
                  know that more engaging content is coming sooner. It would be
                  beneficial if there was some kind of lesson plan or syllabus that
                  explained why repetition is helpful, what they’ll be learning and when,
                  and pushed people to use the “tips” page, which explains the
                  pronunciation rules and gives more explanation for lesson content.

                <!-- <p>(The difficult thing you had to overcome) client hated research, users were hard to come by, data was all screwed up</p> -->
                <p>Because we had no budget, we struggled to recruit diverse participants.
                  Most of our participants had experience learning foreign language(s),
                  and several had experience learning new writing systems.
                </p>
                <p>Because we have no affiliation with Duolingo, we were not able
                  to use any internal data. Not having stakeholders made it difficult
                  to pick our direction and narrow our scope because we were making
                  decisions based on our interests and guesses as to what might be impactful.

                <p>Originally, I wanted to run this study as a diary study in order to
                  understand when users figure out certain features of Duolingo and
                  how they feel when things click.
                  Unfortunately, due to the scope of the course, and the lack of budget,
                  we only did moderated interviews.
                </p>
                <p>We only did a cursory exploration of the streak on Duolingo, but
                  I think that could be an entire study in and of itself. </p>
