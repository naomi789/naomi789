            <p><b>Introduction: </b>
                Naomi Johnson graduated with a bachelor's in Computer Science
                and worked in software engineering before pivoting into UX Research
                and graduating with a master's in Human Centered Design Engineering
                from the University of Washington. She has worked as a UXR in various industries
                (ecommerce, cyber security, education technology)
                and spends her free time volunteering as a UXR mentor on ADPList,
                piecing quilts, and photographing portraits.
            </p>
            <p><b>UXR Philosophy: </b>
                Many focus on data and insights in UX research, but I believe true value
                comes from driving impact. To maximize this, I champion research
                democratization and foster collaborationâ€”ensuring stakeholders
                are engaged at every stage and empowered to act on findings.
