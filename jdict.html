						<h3>Product</h3>
						<p>This website is a fully-functioning Japanese-English dictionary that allows users to add any word they look up into flashcard decks.</p>
						<h3>Summary</h3>
						<p>Over the course of eight weeks, I worked with a team of three software engineers to create and deliver a final product.
							We started with  sketches and paper prototypes,
							did iterative usability testing, completed high-fidelity mockups in Adobe XD,
							created a 3rd normal form relational database in MySQL, and build the front end in JavaScript and HTML/CSS.</p>
						<p>Timeline: May-August 2019</p>
						<p>Team: Luke Wolpert, Zi Zeng, Lavonte Brown (all undergraduate CS majors)</p>
						<p>My role: Product Manager and UX Researcher</p>

						<h3>3. Ideation & Iteration</h3>
						<p>We anticipated most of our users would be high school or university students enrolled in language classes. Instead of creating user personas, we found ten different students who were either studying Japanese, or native Japanese speakers who were learning English, who could participate in interviews and studies. We also interviewed a Japanese language professor in order to gain insight on student language study.</p>
						<!-- 1. Student looks at long vocab list; doesn't want to make paper flashcards (environmental concerns). 2. Uses digital ones online from two years ago, doesn't realize professor changed about 10% of the words for this unit. 3. Makes their own digital ones after struggling to find software that does "triangle" flashcards. 4. Doesn't actually want to study the vocab list bc they think they know most of the words 5. Over-achiver student looks up words they come across while reading a news article online, but forgets to add the word to their study list. -->
						<p>We created a problem scenario storyboard, based on interviews from students, to show what a student's life is like without a dictionary/flashcard app.</p>
				        <div class="carousel">
				            <button id="left-btn"><i class="arrow"></i></button>
				            <img id="carousel-img" src="" alt="">
				            <button id="right-btn"><i class="arrow"></i></button>
				        </div>

						<p>We created a list of requirements for our solution.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Search functionality works with English or Japanese writing systems (Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana, or Romaji).</li>
							<li>Recent queries should be shown as history, but users should be able to delete words.</li>
							<li>Search results should appear below the search bar. Each row will contain the english word, kanji element, hiragana/katakana, romaji, as well as other information about the word entry. To the right of each row will be a "+" button for adding the word entry to a new or preexisting list.</li>
							<li>Users must sign up for free accounts before they create a vocab list/flashcard deck.</li>
							<li>Users should be able to use a filter to view a list of all public vocab lists and their private lists. Users should be able to delete their private vocab lists. Clicking a list will bring the user to that list’s page. </li>
							<li>Each list’s page will display the words in that list and an edit button. The edit button allows users to delete words. From this page, users should be able to start going through flashcards for the words in the deck.</li>
							<li>Once users have started their flashcards/quiz, users should be able to see the reverse side of the page with the click of a button, and self-report if they got the answer right.</li>
							<li>There should be a "settings" page for each flashcard deck where users can see how often they have been quized on each word, how often they get the answer correct, and how long it took them to get the right answer. Using this data, the app should determine which words need to be studied and when.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>We created paper prototypes and ran five 15 minute usability studies where we asked users to look up a word and add it to a flashcard deck. After a few design tweaks, we created clickable wireframes using Balsamiq. After running the same study again, we upgraded to a functional <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/2160138f-f0bb-43da-582e-bb91bdd270b8-5751/">prototype </a> made in AdobeXd.</p>
						<!-- <p> I created user personas, designed user scenarios, created wireframes, and made a functional prototype with AdobeXd. As features became functional on our live site, I designed qualitative user studies, ran them, and analyzed data. Even as we finished the final product, we were gathering data and creating action items that could improve the quality and usability of our site.</p> -->
						<h3>4. Final Solution</h3>
						<p>I wrote Python scripts that converted the JSON files into MySQL statements, used JavaScript to access the database, and displayed the results in HTML. Our fully functional relational database with nine tables that had a combined total of 1.25 million entries, eleven thousand kanji, and tens of thousands of words, some of which had over ten different definitions. My teammates and I got a minimum viable product functioning (signup/login and logout, the search/results page, displays for the flashcard decks and flashcards). From there, we started working on the CSS. Our code is available on <a href="https://github.com/naomi789/2019_4640">GitHub</a>. I earned an "A" on this project and in this course, as did my three collaborators.</p>
						<p>We were able to complete the first seven of eight requirements. We were not able to complete the eighth requirement on time (a page that shows how often a user has been quized on each word, how often they get the answer correct, and how long it took them to get the right answer), but we were able to create backend features to track whether users got flashcards right and how long they spent thinking about it. We have not yet created an algorithm to determine how often users should be quizzed on their vocabulary words, how much they should be rewarded for immediately getting an answer correct, or how many times they need to get it right before we can take the word off the rotation for a while. We hope to create a front end that will display some of this data, as well as  statistics about how many words a user is studying per day.</p>
						<h3>5. Outcome& Impact</h3>
						<p>We identified key reasons why students failed to learn new vocabulary, then created our website in order to streamline the process by combining dictionary and flashcard functionality and by making vocab lists public so students can share them. </p>

						<!-- <p>In addition to writing the code and running the user studies, there are several other features in development.</p> -->
