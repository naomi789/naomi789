							<h3>An introduction:</h3>
							<p>
								I am a software engineer at Microsoft
								actively searching for a project management role.
								Previously, I did SWE work at Adobe Research in 2019,
								both PM and SWE work at Microsoft in 2018,
								and HCI research at Stanford University in 2017.
								I'm data-driven and
								happy to write Python scripts to analyze telemetry
								but equally passionate about customer empathy
								and building relationships with stakeholders.
								See my November 2020 <a href="/resume.pdf">resume</a> for more details
								or my research publications listed on
								<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=S_PjXpoAAAAJ&authuser=1">Google Scholar</a>.

								<!-- or you could check out the research papers I published at UbiComp 2018, CHI 2019, and FIE 2019
								(see my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=S_PjXpoAAAAJ&authuser=1">Google Scholar</a>)! -->

								<!--
								I am detail-oriented, have leadership experience, and love problem solving and negotiating compromises.
								Stanford University's HCI group on UX for designer tools in 2017,
								and worked on a prototype of a data visualization tool at Adobe Research in 2019.
								I did UX research for an internal dashboard at Microsoft in 2018
								I'm currently searching for a role at Microsoft where I can collaboate with customers or other stakeholders to empower others and have tangible impact.
								I have experience working as a UX Researcher, a Software Engineer, and a Program Manager.
								My background is mixed-methods, and I'm very comfortable using Python to analyze quantitative data.
								use my technical and communication skills to empower others.
								moving from SWE to a role here at
								I love talking to customers and stakeholders, writing code to automate tasks or
								planning hackathons and other events with over 300 guests. "My experience working with cross-functional, international teams has taught me the importance of building trusted relationships and inspiring a shared project vision."
								I am a people-person looking for a role where I can collaborate with different stakeholders,

						<h3>aka.ms/mentor</h3><h4>The web database for Microsoft employees</h4>
						<p>I ran usability tests and quantitative surveys; analyzed the data, and created 10 actionable tasks to improve the search and database interface for the Microsoft Mentor program. I ran an exploratory survey regarding future features; results are being considered as we discuss future development plans. Four of my 10 recommendations were implemented during the 2020 Hackathon.</p>

						<h3>Juxxt</h3><h4>Recognizing good design</h4>
						<p>Novice designers are often able to recognize good design but struggle to create it, so we created a GUI-based web development tool that generates design suggestions. I ran five card sorting studies and 10 usability studies. We created a development plan and implemented 15 improvements.</p>
						<!-- <p>Interviewed users to determine placement of settings and menu options. Studied design of landing pages to determine what UI features should be developed. Coded additional settings and options for users.</p> -->

						<h3>Video Annotation Tool</h3><h4>Simplifying data labeling for machine learning</h4>
						<!-- project overview, design process, solution, outcome -->
						<p>Data from gyroscopes and accelerometers often has multiple axises and can be difficult to read, but having a video that shows the sensor does not always make annotators more accurate or efficient. I designed a study to investigate why this might be the case, ran 60 users through the study, and wrote scripts to analyze quantitative data about how users used our Video Annotation Tool (VAT) and their annotations.
						<!-- We determined that users are more willing to skip ahead when they are analyzing with  -->
